<p>Stay tuned for a cool visual... </p>


<p>If you're still interested (which you should be), what these numbers are saying is that in Ontario from 2017-2018, the total number of all ED visits were ~6.4M and out of those, ~1.9M of visits were from frequent ED users.
<a href="https://www.cihi.ca/en" target="_new">The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System</a> defines "Frequent ED user: Patient with four or more ED visits in the fiscal year".
<br>
<p><b>More than 1/4 of Ontario's Emergency Department (ED) visits were from an individual who's been there 4 times or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  What do you think about that?</b></p>
